Besides, even if Debra was definitely not very nice I still don&#8217;t think she deserved to be killed as she was rightfully probably freaked out by Trevor just bursting into their appartement and causing a scene. It was just super unnecessary imo, and especially twisted because Trevor lied to Wade and had him believe Floyd and Debra were still alive afterwards. Not to mention that it&#8217;s implied multiple times that Trevor did some disturbing things to Floyd whilst staying with him initially.</p><p>I know Trevor is an unhinged character and he&#8217;s done worse things, but this just really put me off for some reason. Besides, I really liked the Vespucci Beach condo as a safehouse for the location and especially the interior, and I wish we could have kept it instead of having Trevor suddenly move to the Vanilla Unicorn and now have an office as a second safehouse (how random). But regardless, I wish he at least didn&#8217;t kill Floyd and Debra. (even if it&#8217;s implied on the in-game news it was actually Debra that shot Floyd and Trevor proceeded to kill her afterwards interestingly, but it still escalated because of Trevor just bursting in)</p><p>I know it&#8217;s unlikely Floyd and Debra would have let Trevor and Wade stay with them forever, but idk they could have at least found something that didn&#8217;t end in their death. Trevor could have simply picked up Wade and took him to the Vanilla Unicorn without that entire confrontation or maybe magically Floyd and/or Debra would have a change of heart if Trevor proved himself to be a reliable housemate to them.</p><p>What are your thoughts on this mission?

Here\'s why I believe this....</p><p>1) When Amanda\'s drunk, she\'ll tell Michael she didn\'t like him at first and was interested in ""the other guy"" he was with. It\'s also revealed in hangouts that she got pregnant with Tracey almost immediately after she met Michael and was also working as a hooker at the time.</p><p>2) Amanda doesn\'t answer the question when Michael asks if she ever slept with Trevor, but says ""I feel sick"". If she did sleep with him, at what point did it happen if she and Michael got together so quickly due to the pregnancy?</p><p>3) When you play tennis as Trevor with Amanda, it\'s strongly implied something sexual happened between them at some point.</p><p>4) Has anyone ever noticed how in the painting of the kids in Michael\'s living room, Jimmy looks remarkably similar to Brad in terms of his hair colour and style?</p><p>5) Michael himself even questions if the kids are his own, and Tracey will say she wishes Trevor was her father.</p><p>6) If you call Jimmy up as Trevor on the drive to the airfield to get to North Yankton, Trevor tells Jimmy he\'s always doubted if Michael was his dad. Trevor also digs at lot at Michael about being a father and when he reminds him of Amanda\'s past with prostitution Michael gets really pissy!</p><p>6) Rarely do fictional families ever have similar appearance due to casting limitations, but those kids look nothing like Michael. Surely the animation department could have worked on it and improved the family resemblance a little bit, if one was intended?</p><p>7) Tracey\'s personality is a lot like Trevor\'s. She\'s into drugs and alcohol, she does a lot of stuff to make Michael\'s life harder. She\'s happy to threaten to have her own mother killed in the very first scene she\'s in, which seems very ""Trevor"" to me haha! She loves attention and is kind of ""flighty"" in a similar way to how Trevor is constantly into something or someone\'s business, darting from one big drama to the next.</p><p>8) Jimmy is a hell of a lot like Lester when you break it down, Michael even says so himself when you\'re trailing the janitor guy in the FIB raid set up. They\'re both slightly overweight, both have issues in terms of health and socializing, they\'re both tropey ""shut-in gamers"". They both have absolutely no tolerance for Michael\'s bullsh<em>t and will back talk him like there\'s no tomorrow, and both of them like starting sh</em>t online too.</p><p>9) Tracey is a natural blonde by the looks of it from the old pictures in the De Santa house, and obviously that\'s nothing conclusive but it\'s what originally lead me to wonder about all this....</p><p>The way Michael gets his family back together felt so rushed to me, so I\'ve always wondered if Rockstar intended to do more with that element. I think it seems like they laid a few clues to potentially expand on who was their real daddy in some way, but probably changed their mind because it would be so grim to find out for sure that the kids aren\'t Michael\'s and undoubtedly it would have sent him into a tailspin of depression and violent behaviour which the tone and length of the game didn\'t really allow for.</p><p>Anyway, just a theory that\'s something a bit different to the whole Chiliad thing or if we\'re ever going to see story DLC haha!</p>', 'image': None, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/GrandTheftAutoV/comments/16u3zy7/was_it_intended_for_michael_to_discover_that/', 'username': '/u/Confident-Penalty558', 'username_url': 'https://www.reddit.com/user/Confident-Penalty558', 'created': '2023-09-28T02:30:44Z'}, {'id': 3491033, 'name': 'can you not train chop anymore?', 'text': ""<p>I've played GTA 5 for only 30 hours or so, i heard you could download an Ifruit app on your phone to train chop.

Killing him prevents this, and weakens the Forsworn overall so they will be less able to kill innocents as well.

I did a lot of the quests, and explored most of the map. Had to follow guides of course. </p><p>I walk away from this game with mixed emotions. It is truly a gigantic conquest. This was my largest continuous undertaking as a gamer ever and I am feeling exhausted. It&#8217;s so large and intricate that it started to feel like an actual epic, unfolding in real-time days. </p><p>By the very end I did feel the sting of the difficulty spike. I had to push to get to the end. I tried the last fight for 3 days. I finally won it today. Just before I had landed the final blow, I was feeling quite frustrated and angry even, and split second later when the hit landed on the beast, I felt an emotional silence in me. Just&#8230;nothing. I had done it. The game rolled credits no more than 60 seconds later and I just started pacing around the room. I knew I had done it; done &#8220;something&#8221;. The longest, hardest-fought play through I have ever had. However I was more in a mood of silence than victory. I watched the PS5 go to sleep automatically. I didn&#8217;t want to touch the controller. </p><p>I am a seasoned (casual) gamer but I had never taken the chance on any FromSoftware games due to their popular difficulty. I had read ER is relatively easier and it was on sale so I picked it up. I also knew it was GOTY last year and a super hit game in general so I had a curiosity to at least see some of it. My plan was that if I could get even 10-15 hours of fun out of it, it&#8217;d be alright. In hindsight I got a far better deal than I had expected. </p><p>After I beat the game, I stuck around for a few more hours, hopping from grace to grace, revisiting the continent, which had not lent me an inch without a having to fight to earn the right to progress. A truly beautiful setting. And then, after some more quiet time, I uninstalled it.</p><p>A few moments later, I spoke to a friend of mine that I had done it. While speaking to him, I started to feel bad somehow, that it was over. I went to YouTube just to see its trailers; I had absolutely not followed any marketing for this game at all and every trailer was new to me. Watching those trailers I realised I had just been playing an &#8220;impossible&#8221; game. The quality, the scope, just how much of it is good, and that it met the expectations it had set for the fans. </p><p>I wasn&#8217;t even there for the hype train but I have arrived at the station almost 2 years later. I&#8217;ll be here for the DLC, and then the next game. </p><p>I went back to my PS5 this evening and I am not even able to pick what to play now. I don&#8217;t want to play more ER because I am truly exhausted of it at this moment and I want to remember this feeling. </p><p>ER is worth the money, and deserving of the praise. It is not a perfect game, nothing is. Given how much it gets right, and especially just how much of it there is, this is a game beyond generic critique. It&#8217;s an epic in itself. What an amazing piece of art. I am so impressed with this game.

After what I realized soon after as literally dealing with her trauma through the visualization of the Rat King, this moment near the end of Day 2 all the way to after the beginning of Day 3 is where it fully clicked for me, and from there I understood and started to root for her journey more and more. It recontextualized my feelings on Abby\'s guilt, motivations, and her lack of purpose/getting past trauma and a bunch of her scenes with Lev. Her confrontation against Tommy and later Zack in particular had also shown me the smaller \'breaking free from bias and lack of perspective\' part of her arc more clearly. Mel\'s scene in particular shows greatly how Abby doesn\'t want to be a bad person anymore and her being ashamed of what she has done and hoping to her soul that she\'ll still be able to change.

27,Mortal Kombat 11,274480,"{'count': 10286, 'next': 'https://api.rawg.io/api/games/274480/reddit?key=d9d40bde0780447c9e6eb060c9e9c4da&page=2', 'previous': None, 'results': [{'id': 3441503, 'name': 'Blood Colors in Mortal Kombat 11 are Weird.', 'text': '<p>Mortal Kombat and blood go together like butter and toast. We all know this. Mortal Kombat 11 is definitely one of, if not the bloodiest in the franchise, but one thing about Mortal Kombat 11 in particular that I find rather weird is the color of certain characters\' blood.</p><p>First off, D\'Vorah\'s darker teal blood, being changed to a brighter cyan. This is probably because of the way RGB values are processed for the blood colors. I came to this conclusion when mucking around with the RGB Blood Modifier tool which is a part of Ermaccer\'s MK11 Hook PC mod.</p><p>I tried recreating Noob\'s blackish purple blood from Mortal Kombat 9, and what I ended up getting was a regular shade of purple, rather than a dark one. I even tried the RGB value of 1 0 1 to see what that\'d do. I still got a normal shade of purple. Therefore it\'s possible the developers wanted to go for a darker teal color for D\'Vorah, but they couldn\'t because of how the game processed the RGB values.</p><p>Speaking of Noob, he has standard red blood, a color we haven\'t seen for the character since Mortal Kombat 4, as in that game, they didn\'t seem to bother giving characters like Reptile and Cyrax their unique blood colors, and besides, Noob had red blood at the time anyways. I would have expected Noob to have a dark colored blood like he had in Deception through to Mortal Kombat 9.</p><p>Now onto Frost. While she has always had red blood in the series, she is depicted as a cyborg in Mortal Kombat 11, and as a cyborg you\'d expect her to have a unique blood color. Cyborgs normally have black blood, or fluorescent blue in the case of Cyber Sub Zero in Mortal Kombat 9. Not Frost though. They gave her basic red blood, despite her brand new cyber form. Not to mention Cyrax and Sektor are in the game as Story Mode exclusive opponents, and they have black blood, so why not Frost, as she\'s a cyborg too?</p><p>Here\'s one I\'m sure you all remember. In early builds of Mortal Kombat 11, Geras bled bright blue blood (try saying that five times fast) which I remember being pissed about when they changed it to red in later builds of the beta. It was something that definitely fit his character as an artificial construct, not to mention it works with his design. (Note: I only recently started playing Mortal Kombat 11, but I have had my eye on the game since its reveal trailer dropped.)</p><p>A popular suggestion I\'ve seen would be to have Geras bleed sand as it makes sense with his abilities. While I guess it makes sense, it would definitely be very hard to implement into the game as it isn\'t blood. Plus we have characters like Skarlet who manipulate opponents blood, and there\'s also the different gory wounds and injuries shown in finishing moves to take into account, so it likely wouldn\'t work out.</p><p>Next up is Robocop. ""Why Robocop?"" you might ask. Well, you see, his blood is shown as gray in Mortal Kombat 11. This is really strange to me as while he is a cyborg, Cyrax and Sektor, who are cyborgs, have black blood in this game, not gray. Meanwhile Robocop has gray blood, and is therefore inconsistent with the other cyborgs.</p><p>Finally I\'d like to give honorable mentions to Cetrion and Kollector who were definitely planned to have unique blood colors at first, at least according to the designs of their severed heads in the Krypt. Cetrion\'s severed head is shown to have blue blood, similar to Geras in early versions of the beta. While Cetrion having blue blood would look cool, I don\'t mind Cetrion having red blood either. Kollector\'s severed head is shown to have yellow, metallic blood, almost like liquid gold. This makes sense as Kollector loves his gold. However, this is cool in concept, and not in execution, as when I tried to give Kollector gold blood with MK11 Hook, it ended up looking like mustard, or worse, like piss.</p><p>And thus concludes my random essay (if you could call it that) talking about the blood colors of Mortal Kombat 11.

Or, alternatively, how do I keep my momentum going? Because, you see, I already have 2 abilities which slow time down (blink and the mid-air focus) which also slow me down (and same goes for the grapple btw, doesn\'t go slowmo but still slows me) after using them preventing me from keeping my normal speed (also who tf thought it was a good idea to add slowmo in a fast paced game? whatever). </p><p>The other reason why I\'m asking this is because every time I try to play fast I almost always end up being shot. Like is the slowmo REALLY that much necessary that I can\'t even fight a single enemy without it? I get the the slowmo is a huge component in the combat system, but using it just feels like turning baby mode on to me. Why am I supposed to slow down in a game where everything is meant to be fast? It just doesn\'t make sense to me. </p><p>This problem aside, I\'m kinda liking this game. I prefer Titanfall 2, but this game is close enough to feel like a spiritual successor. Also because there\'s many similarities and I\'m also kinda sure that there is a TF|2 reference in this game (the ""Can\'t run, can\'t hide"" trophy might be referencing Viper\'s line ""Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide"", but it might as well not be a reference purely because of the fact that it\'s just a common one-liner cool characters say in fiction).

Combat mostly boils down to dodge, jump, slash, dash, air dash, use your power making it easy to get into whilst simultaneously having a VERY high skill ceiling. Customising your perks is pretty simple, you just place upgrade tetris blocks"" into this box and the amount of upgrades you can have are limited by how much space is left to fit in new blocks.</p><p>No live service bullshit, the only DLC released is project HEL and a few skins for the sword but that\'s about it</p><p>Unique, satisfying combat which constantly keeps you on the edge of your seat like no other game. You die in one hit whilst having to dodge lasers and enemies everywhere in high speed action. Like DOOM eternal but you can\'t shoot(which makes it even more high risk and intense).</p><p>Varied and challenging enemy design</p><p>Level design is very engaging and stage gimmicks(like slow down or shuriken power ups) are implemented in fun ways which require precise timing and spice things up but aren\'t overdone to the point of exhaustion.</p><p>Movement is incredibly fun where you grapple, slide, wall run everywhere at high speeds.</p><p>Speaking of which, wall running exists and has no limitations. You can wall run on pretty much anything. In fact the game was BUILT around speedrunners doing crazy skips/sequence breaks with wall running.</p><p>You instantly respawn after death which keeps you constantly in the action</p><p>Killer synthwave soundtrack</p><p>Cool cyberpunk authoritarian dystopia aesthetic/setting</p><p>No cutscenes that break the flow of the game but instead exposition and dialogue happens as you explore through each level</p><p>Engaging storyline where you are thrown in the middle of a rebel coup as a cyborg who has just been woken up and gradually learn more and more about what\'s going on and how things became the way they are in the dystopia.</p><p>Gameplay - 10/10</p><p>Traversal - 10/10</p><p>Story - 8/10</p><p>Soundtrack - 10/10</p><p>Graphics - 6/10</p><p>But overall still a 10/10 because of how it\'s completely nails the most important aspects.</p>', 'image': None, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/GhostRunner/comments/12c9ouj/not_exaggurating_when_i_say_i_believe_this_is_the/', 'username': '/u/RedditIsTrashLma0', 'username_url': 'https://www.reddit.com/user/RedditIsTrashLma0', 'created': '2023-04-05T05:31:04Z'}, {'id': 3439696, 'name': 'Cybervoid complaints are overblown', 'text': '<p>They take up such an insignificant portion of the game\'s runtime it\'s pretty much a non-issue.</p><p>There\'s about 5 cybervoid sections(not including the final mission).

He was responsible for the missing children. </p><p>People have been arguing that Arlecchino is a terrible person based on all the open quest information saying she traficked children, scheme a flood to make more orphans and even donating children to The Doctor as test subjects. But based on this quest and also fontaine archon quest, it seems like she\'s a completely different character, almost innocent-like by her cluelessness of the fontaine\'s archon indentity.</p><p>So it would seem the terrible reputation of House of Hearth and agents were brought upon the previous Knave instead of Arlecchino. Which makes a lot of sense how she would be playable in the future.

Why not make the MC an auror who is recruited by Hogwarts? At least then it would make sense.</p><p>You spend next to no time in actual classes and you don&#8217;t even feel like a student.

Does anyone actually care about Ranrok and the plot revolving around him? Ffs, the Sebastian side missions were more fun than the actual main plot. </p><p>For the next game it would be nice if you could play as an auror, wandering around the Ministry of Magic and Hogwarts if the devs want to make you feel like a badass warrior.

Yes, I do understand you can counter it with another Air Patrol, but what about player-controlled streaks like a Chopper Gunner, a VTOL Escort or a FUCKING GUNSHIP? You just sit there and hope some cool guy on your team helps you. Heck, there was a match where I got a Strafe Run and a HARP from a Care Package, people called a Air Patrol on my Strafe Run, I called one too and countered it. Then another smartass called one on my Strafe Run and there was nothing I could do. Then I used the HARP I got from my Care Package, and 4 seconds later another guy destroyed it with Air Patrol.

I was astonished by the graphics, by the gameplay mechanics, and also by the plot, even though it had some holes.</p><p>However, it\'s sequel only has the better plot as a redeeming value. As I played Requiem, it seemed as though that the developers did not care and, with respect, they were high on psychodelic drugs as they made each sequence and game mechanics. It looked as if dumb idiots drinking dumbfuck juice under the command of other dumb idiots drinking dumbfuck juice were making decisions which made no sense and tried to be the ultimate a-hole for the player.</p><p>Luckily, I have a whole list prepared as to why this statement might be true. Redditors, sit down comfortably and read it all.</p><p>Let\'s start with optimization. A sequel made approximately 3 years after the first game has such an optimization that it\'s close to making my computer literally pee on medium settings. When playing Innocence, there was no such issue.</p><p>Graphics style is way different and for the worse. For some dumb reason Amicia in Innocence clearly looks like she\'s 15, but in Requiem taking place 6 months later she has the facial bone structure of an 18-year-old woman. You can\'t change into an 18-year-old in 6 months. This is just unbelievable. Am I really supposed to think that a woman with facial structure of an 18-year-old is in fact 15? Just look at her face.</p><p>Speaking of graphics, the style is also different. In Innocence everything was gritty and dark and rogue-like. The player knew it was all serious and set in a dark tone. Suddenly, in Requiem, it all looks as if we moved into renaissance in these 6 months. The lighting seems warm and colorful and it really breaks the immersion of the apocalyptic world we are supposed to be in, even in dark scenes.</p><p>Another style issue - enemies. In Innocence they really looked medieval. They had chainmail, plate armor, correct helmets, accurate equipment - maybe except for the shield bearers. The English troops looked still a bit different than the Inquisition troops. In Requiem, however, it is nothing but a downgrade. We have soldiers wearing riveted shoulder pads and gorgets, something we would see among early medieval barbarians or in Mad Max. They try their hardest to make their troops consistent, but they fail in doing so in everything apart from the villagers in the first fight. In Innocence we have light soldiers wearing chainmail without helmets and medium soldiers wearing some plate and helmets like kettle helmets or sallet helmets. They had spears and they were able to throw them once and then they drew their swords and charged at us. There were also heavier troops but they were rarer and had polearms or shields. All accurate. In Requiem we have a bad attempt at making enemy classes. There are light helmetless troops having javelins (WHO TF STILL USED JAVELINS IN EUROPEAN MID 1300s?!). There are common medium troops having kettle helmets AND NOTHING ELSE and ALL of them have AXES (somehow they forgot their swords). There are also heavy big boys all in plate armor and having large chain morningstars - weapons which probably did not even exist because it was dangerous for the user themselves. The only good troop here is an archer and it\'s because they haven\'t touched archers since Innocence. - In Innocence each faction has some diversity of each troops, their armor differs. In Requiem it\'s all just a lazy recolor depending on whether they are bandits or Provance soldiers. </p><p>Thanks to all of the reasons above, we also completely forget we are in the middle of the HUNDRED YEARS\' WAR. No English, no French per se.</p><p>Let\'s hop onto the absolute worst part of the game - the combat system. This game tryhards to be The Last Of Us so much only to end up as it\'s annoying little cousin. First of all, knives. In this game, knives are rare, ONLY one use, you CANNOT craft them anyhow, and you may only have max 3 of them after the last equipment upgrade. Am I supposed to believe that a sturdy steel knive is one-use-only and then it somehow breaks all the time? ""bUt WhItErEd yOu DuMbFuCk!11!!!!11!! pErM KnIvEs LiKe ThIs WoUlD RuIn tHe gAmE!11!!!! YoU DOnT UnDeRsTaNd!!!11!!"" If the devs give knives instead of flimsy shivs, they\'d better do it right. Amicia seems to be intelligent but has too low IQ to actually yank the knife out of the soldier after he kills him. She SHOULD be using a knife multiple times because these knives were made by blacksmiths and made out of steel. The downside of using a knife could be, let\'s say, a different outcome with the characters or a different pathway to pass further levels. Let&#8217;s say it leaves blood. I am not sure myself, I am not a game developer wasting my life in front of a computer screen like Asobo Studio did, but I don\'t have to be a carpenter to know that my roof is leaking.</p><p>Crossbow is another issue. Crossbows became more popular than bows because of the three reasons: they were accurate, took less training, and used cheaper ammunition than the longbow. Amicia is a John Wick as soon as she picks up the crossbow. Next, we see that the crossbow first has a windlass. Later she can span it with her hand alone. If a 15 yo girl can span it with her hand, it means that the crossbow has very little power and wouldn&#8217;t really kill people. Hasn&#8217;t Asobo Studio heard of something like belt and claw? Or a goat&#8217;s foot lever? No? Oh well, I am probably expecting too much of them anyway.</p><p>The crossbow bolts are very rare. That shouldn&#8217;t be an issue because crossbow bolts were shorter, simpler in build, and therefore cheaper. What is more, Amicia can hold at most 5 crossbow bolts, which is just ultimately pathetic. Last time I checked a crossbowman could have 20 at most. Even 15 crossbow bolts would be believable, but not 5, especially with ammunition supposed to be cheap in these times.</p><p>Every enemy walks like a terminator every time they have to fight Amicia. That way Amicia and even Hugo can outrun them.</p><p>Amicia forgets how to craft Devorantis, something she crafted very often in her journey in Innocence. &#8220;bUt WhItErEd iT Is SuPpOseD tO RePrEsEnT Amicia&#8217;s LaCk oF fRiEnDs AnD LoSs oF ThAt ThiEf GuRl yOu KnObHeAd!1!11!!!&#8221;. The fact that this thief girl left Amicia is one thing, but she should still remember the recipe for Devorantis or have it written somewhere.</p><p>Because of unexplicable illogical and dumb mechanics like lack of Devorantis, rare one-use-only knives and rare crossbow bolts, enemies in helmets are a nuisance. Asobo Studios knew about this fully well and that&#8217;s why there are tar jars in every single section having soldiers with helmets. This left the player make only one move to kill the soldiers with helmets on.</p><p>One of the worst parts &#8211; skills&#8217; system. The more Amicia does something, the more skilled she&#8217;s at it. In theory it is brilliant, in practice it just sucks. With this system implemented, it means that if someone wants to sneak easier, they have to already sneak well enough to avoid every single enemy without being seen when there are enemies around every corner always looking around for Amicia and noticing her as soon as she pops out of cover. Then the skill just doesn&#8217;t make anything really better &#8211; the player is already skilled in sneaking without Amicia&#8217;s skills. This is why the achievement for maxing out fighting skills is many times more common than achievement for maxing out stealth skills on Steam. It&#8217;s just way easier to fight these enemies through rather than sneaking past them just to get skills which supposedly make sneaking easier.</p><p>All in all, it seems as though Asobo Studios forgot that A Plague Tale is not supposed to be The Last Of Us in the medieval era, but their own game just inspired by The Last Of Us while keeping the medieval realities intact.</p><p>If these mechanics and features mentioned above aren&#8217;t at all frustrating to you, then I welcome discussions with firm and logical arguments. I won&#8217;t accept sentences like &#8220;otherwise the game would be broken&#8221; because there&#8217;s always a way to create balanced gameplay while keeping realities believable. There is no way Asobo Studios could break their game with making knives have more uses or by making crossbow bolts more common and numerous in Amicia&#8217;s quiver.</p><p>If somebody really enjoyed Requiem, then I am proud of this.

Thus red strings connecting Yuito and Kasane I see as a fact that their destinies became interlinked due to Yuito being alive depending on the fact that Kasane traveled back in time thus creating an entanglement in red strings terminal.</p>', 'image': None, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/ScarletNexus/comments/16mpn3f/are_yuito_and_kasane_siblings/', 'username': '/u/SnooHedgehogs7477', 'username_url': 'https://www.reddit.com/user/SnooHedgehogs7477', 'created': '2023-09-19T12:28:26Z'}, {'id': 3504064, 'name': 'Is there a birthday party somewhere? where is she bringing all that cake?', 'text': '', 'image': 'https://preview.redd.it/80c2wlm095pb1.png?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=89772524cee0aed37c2258e1b8e2fe6c23059c6d', 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/ScarletNexus/comments/16mhv4k/is_there_a_birthday_party_somewhere_where_is_she/', 'username': '/u/re-kidan', 'username_url': '', 'created': '2023-09-19T04:58:16Z'}, {'id': 3504063, 'name': 'Not quite done yet', 'text': '<p>74 hours in and completed both routes, completed all achievements (not all challenges) and played entirely on very hard (excluding farming in the vision simulator).</p><p>Next up is getting those &#8220;beat X route in under 15 hours&#8221; weapons.</p><p>Blast of a game.

I drove it like maybe 15 min at best and was done with it.</p><p>Now I restarted playing from the beginning, new game+ with my choice of rules. Since I'm not a beginner anymore and know the tricks I sold most of the starter trucks, got the Paystar 5070, Tayga and after some contracts the Azov 6. I realized since you don't have the proper upgrades and level lock items such as mud tires and offroad transmissions, the beginning of the game is such a grind until you unlock them. </p><p>I felt paystar was quite underwhelming, It kept spinning tires a lot with the 5 slot sideboard on Island Lake's muddy roads, having difficulty to pull well. I soon fed up with it, sold it and bought the Voron D. And oh boy, what a pleasing surprise it was. Since it comes with always on awd and difflock I know it would be good but not this good. The strongest point of it that it comes with an offroad transmission already. Which is immense for the start as none of the other trucks have acces to it until late michigan and some level ups. Also without lifted suspension and dual rear tires it's reasonably stable. It is strong enough for heavy loads with 5 slot and and the High gear is reasonably fast for an offroad transmission. It pulls well without slowing or bogging down on mud. The only negative side I can find is the fuel consumption which is high for it's size and class but not terrible. Overall a great beginner and mid tier truck for vanilla regions. Not sure how it will perform on kola.</p><p>I strongly recommend it to the beginners starting from Michigan.

I know I'm sounding cryptic here like as if I'm from the FBC myself but I promise you I will share my data once I've compiled it. There's two versions I'd like to have accessible, the first version is the regular version from Jesse's point of view when she comes out if the cave. The second is a no clip version with focus on former leaving thru the pillars with the point of interest being were he comes from and when he goes in that scene. If somebody has footage or is able to point me the right direction of footage it would be greatly appreciated and you would obviously be credited.

And after connecting things here and there on in my mind place, like Saga, i think i have a theory. </p><p><em>In case if this theory isn\'t fresh - i searched the web for same ideas, but haven\'t found anything (except for quantum break theories), maybe someone already came up with same conclusions - and if they did - sorry for wasting Your time.</em> </p><p>SO... the theory...<strong>Tim Breaker is Dylan Faden</strong> <em>(but in one of the alternate universes, where Dylan travels while dreaming)</em><strong>.</strong> </p><p>Both Dylan and Tim Breaker were in contact with Mr. Door. I\'m pretty sure You all heard about Mr.Door appearing in Control and in Alan Wake 2, in Control we heard about Mr.Door from Dylan, in AW2 - Mr.Door transports Tim Breaker in the Dark Place. Tim says it all feels like dream - here we have connection with Dylan - he described how he sees many dreams (yes, that\'s not very convincing - we all have a dreams). But further we have more connections. </p><p>On Tim\'s investigation board we have many things, but most interesting in this theory are two things - there\'s note about ""red-headed woman"" and annotation near it ""me, but not me"" - i think this can be interpreted as brother and sister connection, blood relation, especially since both of them were powerful parautilitarians. 2nd thing from this board - polyhedrons. He draws polyhedrons, he sees them in his dreams, you can see UFO books on his desk at sheriff\'s office and you can find his notes in the forest near Cauldron Lake - he thought this is UFO, he tried to capture it in the night sky - and all this time he was seeing Polaris images, he\'s been touched by it, just like Jesse. </p><p>Also, Tim always humming ""Night Springs"" intro song, and says himself that ""he can\'t get out this melody out of his head""... I restarted Control just after completing AW2, and what do i hear? Jesse in internal dialogue with Polaris describes Hiss as a ""infuriating melody, that makes you humm it over and over""... Whole this time, as Dylan was traveling worlds - he was infested by Hiss, and it manifests in him humming one melody over and over (you can hear this dialogue <a href=""https://youtu.be/fcDK6tnx4vM?si=iuEAOf7cIw-f9Dzt&amp;t=945"">here (15:45-16:02)</a> ).Also, a little obscure detail - Tim tells to Alan, that he has a sister (previously appeared character in AW1) Sarah Breaker, who works for ""Federal Bureau"", hmm, which one? Sarah maybe working for FBI, but his sister from another universe HMMMMM???And also - both actors Tim\'s and Dylan\'s - Shawn Ashmore and Sean Durrie - look very similar...Let me know what you guys think! </p><p>Could i convince you or am i just a looney? :DP.S.

The logical takeaway is that the system might actually work much more effectively and bring the desired results if the collective punishment was taken out of the equation.

Ellie returns to the farmhouse she shared with Dina and their son, JJ, only to find it abandoned. Dina has left, taking JJ with her. The house is filled with remnants of their life together, highlighting what Ellie has lost in her pursuit of vengeance. Ellie tries to play the guitar Joel gave her, but she struggles because she lost two fingers in her fight with Abby, symbolizing her physical and emotional scars.</p><p>Now, I&#8217;m making this post because I&#8217;ve been a bit out of touch and was hoping to talk about the game a bit since I don\'t know anyone who likes the game as much as I do.

I may have missed or forgotten something while writing this up.</p><p>Ellie was 14 at the beginning of the first game. </p><p>Boston can get very shitty and slushy with snow during Winter, so it had to be early Spring to early Summer (2034) when Joel, Ellie, and Tess fought their way to the Capitol building. </p><p>It was also still warm in Bill's Town and throughout the Pittsburgh encounter. </p><p><code>Note: With the details we have, I'm almost certain Ellie was born sometime in early 2020.</code></p><p>It was early Fall by the time Ellie &amp; Joel got to the Jackson County dam, and the temps were getting colder at the University of Easter Colorado. <sup>Go</sup> Big Horns.</p><p>The war with David's Cannibal Crew&#8482; took place in the Winter of 2035. We knownit was Spring when they finally reached Salt Lake City. Ellie turned 15 in there somewhere, since this was nearly a year after leaving Boston.</p><p>I'm willing to bet it was mid-Summer when the pair returned to Jackson to end Part I. At this point, Ellie would have been 15 for a few months at least. </p><p><code>Note: Since Joel had already taught Ellie to swim when they took her birthday camping trip to the Wyoming Museum of Natural History, that trip was a gift for her *16^th * birthday.</code> </p><p>The Part II timeline begins 4 years later, so she was at <em>least</em> 19, but considering it's Winter (2040) during the patrol chapter, she would have either already turned 20, or very close to turning 20 if her birthday falls in February or March. </p><p>It was cold and shitty in Seattle (because it's Seattle). It's likely in late Winter, since Tommy &amp; Jesse were assuming the snow would have thawed in Utah during their return trip to Jackson. Therefore, they arrived back in Jackson in the Spring of 2040. </p><p>Dina was early in her first trimester in Seattle, so add another 8 months post-Seattle for J.J.'s birth. That means J.J. was born in November or December of 2040. </p><p>Add another 8 months by the time we see the Farmhouse interlude chapter, because Potato was older than an infant, but doesn't quite look like he's a year old. The Farmhouse chapter then begins in May, June, or July of 2041. Thus, Ellie was already 21 for that chapter. </p><p>We don't know how much time passes at the Farmhouse before Ellie leaves for Santa Barbara, but it's getting chilly at night during the late-night sequence after Tommy's visit (Ellie getting out of bed, shivering, and closing windows). It's safe to assume it's mid-Fall by then. We'll call it October of 2041.</p><p>The trek to Santa Barbara - solo - took up to three months. This is assumed for two reasons: </p><p>(1) Ellie spent nearly a week just getting through the Las Vegas area, hiding from the roaming hoard of Infected and, </p><p>(2) there are no direct routes connecting Las Vegas to Santa Barbara by road. Using roads, Ellie would have needed to either head to Paso Robles and turn south, head to Thousand Oaks/Ventura and turn north, or traverse the foothills from Bakersfield to the coast. Those aren't the Rocky Mountains by any means, but they aren't small either. </p><p>It isn't Winter when Ellie reaches Santa Barbara, or even close to it. The only reason that isn't Hoodie-weather in the morning on the California Central Coast (SLO down to Oxnard) is usually May-August. So it must be around Springtime of 2042 when she gets to the Pacific Coast. She's definitely 22 by then.</p><p>As best I can tell, Ellie returns to the empty farmhouse late Summer of 2042 at 22 years old.</p><p>Edit: formatting.</p>"", 'image': None, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/thelastofus/comments/1cu86jt/the_last_of_us_timeline_and_ellies_age_at_the_end/', 'username': '/u/ninjapimp42', 'username_url': 'https://www.reddit.com/user/ninjapimp42', 'created': '2024-05-17T15:30:33Z'}, {'id': 3545878, 'name': 'Bro went flying', 'text': '', 'image': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/bTZxMWhwaXVpeTBkMZl5uckzqUmuqtHfj5yTsURudBc2MkREPuKdr8etqKdX.png?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=b75c199c67eb436e4b6472161dfaa53b2084403b', 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/thelastofus/comments/1cu15fh/bro_went_flying/', 'username': '/u/Sad-Candidate2239', 'username_url': '', 'created': '2024-05-17T09:38:59Z'}]}",Any part 2 subs that aren’t riddled with transphobia/homophobia/misogyny?,What is the most canon ending (SPOILERS IN THE MESSAGE),minecraft zombie??,the last of us woodburninggg,No matter how many times I play part 2 I still get that kind of anxiety that hurts your stomach when crossing the sky bridge,Joel in Seattle after Ellie’s murder,Ellie's Tattoo,"Low key, I think playing as Abby w/ Lev during Holdout mode makes me more conscious of keeping my ally alive.",The Last of Us Timeline and Ellie's Age at the End of Part II,Bro went flying

My thoughts for anyone considering a purchase / play ...', 'text': '<p>Ps5 / Ps plus (free\'ish) + Dlc ending (sale &#163;&#8364;$3).</p><p>So for about &#163;&#8364;$3 this game is amazing. For 70.... it\'s not lol </p><p>I\'d pay...39.99 for it all ...as it\'s a AA masquerading as a AAA and i believe the laugh cost vs what there was....is what upset so many people.</p><p>The game in 2023 October is <strong>very stable</strong> (solid 60fps) and now has some extra modes are. It\'s a big install but graphically the game is very good.... though it doesn\'t do much with those good graphics hence the AA rating. It\'s a much smaller game than the trailers might make you believe.</p><p>It has a <strong>story</strong>...it\'s a bad one but for a game it\'s fine. It has good acting and actors I like... but a weak script. But it\'s nice to have a single player with some story. It was...serviceable. </p><p>The <strong>sound and music</strong> is good. Not amazing. But it gets the job done.</p><p>The <strong>lastabilty</strong> / length is fine. It took me like 10hrs and that was enough. 3 more for dlc. So a 12hr -15 he game. That\'s enough. And new game plus and a hard core mode. Overall Good value if on sale or if on a sub service like plus.</p><p>The <strong>gameplay</strong> is...mostly fun. I really enjoyed the janky melee combat but it\'s very odd and takes getting use to ...And arguably never truly works. It\'s like boxing which is neat and different. Everything else is kind of onrails...And like a fancy walking sim which repeats the same mostly enjoyable gameplay again ... and again... and again. </p><p>And There is a neat upgrade system which you\'ve seen else where but it worked and looked cool. </p><p>During your 10ish hrs You\'ll not do anything exciting or new and you\'ll do that alot haha But it\'s still fun ...and fine for the most part.</p><p><strong>It\'s not scary</strong>. It\'s very atmospheric and spooky ...but I didn\'t jump once. I enjoyed this level of horror over dead space and others in this genre...which are too scary. I liked being able to play without too much fear...just tension. There are jump scares but they\'re just silly. The entire game is like a good b-movie horror or chiller.</p><p>Though There are some <strong>real issues</strong> with the manual save as it simply doesn\'t work and checkpoints can be annoying. Also the end area with silent enemies is massively overused. And there are large sections where you think something will happen but nothing does. Despite a high budget I feel alot was cut...And the game suffers for it.</p><p>&#9679;<strong>Pros:</strong> graphics, acting, production values, the upgrade system, gameplay, value if free. Sci-fi setting. Combat (for some).</p><p>&#9679;<strong>Cons:</strong> the endless crawling through vents and walls. It\'s a loading area mechanic we\'ve seen before but here it\'s used obnoxiously. The repetition. The lack of enemy types (4!). The lack of bosses (1 boss!!!! And 1 minor boss). The clunky combat and resulting cheap deaths. The save system is broken. The checkpoint system is flawed. The story is weak. And There are a lack of original ideas in a very familiar setting.</p><p><strong>So yes more cons than pros</strong>... but because there is a actually a much better game hidden under the dross, even the cons can\'t fully hide that! And a sequel could really shine as a result.</p><p>It\'s like dead space lite. And it\'s a shame that the best / original idea are used so sparingly. Oddly enough it\'s in the dlc that the best ideas are used the most. Too little too late? </p><p>The calisto protocol is like...the evil within 1 (not 2). But not as good or as scary but very similar ...as well as dead space 1..or maybe 3 which was weaker. Sadly <strong>it\'s rarely it\'s own game and that\'s a missed opportunity.</strong></p><p>Apparently the studio has seen massive layoffs and the top guy who made this and co made dead space ...was fired / has left. It sold 2 million but for 135 million budget and it allegedly needed to sell 5 million to be successful and warrant a sequel. Though ironically with psplus... it has easily reached 5 million. So it\'s a bit...kind of but also a failure.</p><p>If I\'m honest the game does not look or play like a 135 million dollar game. Not sure what went wrong , as all they did was copy other better games. But.... It\'s still <strong>a solid, smaller , fun game once you lower your expectations.</strong></p><p>It\'s fine!

I was told by almost everyone the dlc was ""bad"". I was told it was a ""rushed cash grab""...and maybe that\'s true...as putting the canon ending behind a paywall / season pass.... was wrong. </p><p>But <strong>the devs have paid the price.</strong> People lost their jobs :( But this dlc cost me &#163;&#8364;$3 and the main game was free.... so my expectations and my investment was much lower than those at launch. </p><p>I sympathise for early adopters but the hate is no longer deserved. Like TCP the DLC is much more than far too many claimed it to be...But sadly much less than I wanted.</p><p>Possibly as a result of the above...<strong>I really had fun with the dlc.</strong> I felt it was a natural progression of the main game and had many of the ideas implemented which I\'m guessing were meant to be in the main game... but weren\'t likely due to ""time constraints"". </p><p>The <strong>GRAPHICS</strong> are still good but the dlc doesn\'t offer any new areas of note which is such a shame as you\'ll spend way too much time in familiar, often confusing corridors. But their is a new organic cobweb effect. It\'s all ok but nothing new. I had hoped for more.</p><p>The <strong>SOUND &amp; MUSIC</strong> is still fine. As is the voice acting...what little there is of it. Everyone does their best ...though the doctor is certainly one for the weaker actors. One extra character/ actor in the dlc would have really helped.</p><p>The <strong>STORY</strong> is even more confusing and the script is as weak as before. It doenst make much sense but again for a game it\'s just fine. I enjoyed the obvious twist as it has a dark comedy vibe to it. Especially if you wait till the credits have rolled...Don\'t quit out at the end if you have a sick sense of humour (not for everyone ;). </p><p>Oddly enough the <strong>GAMEPLAY</strong> is where the dlc shines. I really enjoyed the combat...probably because I was finally comfortable with it. </p><p>There is 1 new npc, 1 new boss and 1 new weapon. The new hammer weapon is amazing! They really nail it\'s look , feel and sound.</p><p>Sadly it\'s all gone too soon which make you realise all of the additions should have been in TCP. And the hammer should have been used throughout the dlc. The latter just solves so many combat issues and Is a sweet alternative to the baton. </p><p>There are silent hill <strong>psychological horror</strong> elements to the dlc not seen elsewhere and lots of cool tricks and traps which I subsequently wanted to see and expected (but weren\'t) in the main game. </p><p>Its inclusion in a action horror is a little jarring , leading to a feeling like the devs were doing all they could to sell the game for a sequel but all too little too late. But still fun and again shows the potential of the series.</p><p>The boxing at times finally reaches what I\'m sure the devs wanted all along but never achieved at launch. Occasionally against crowds and the new androids you\'ll find yourself having a blast of a time and when you die you\'re actually excited to play again! This is a massive step up and what the main game needed to succeed.</p><p>The <strong>DLC LENGTH</strong> is about 3 hrs long. It\'s too short and due to the repetition and resused assets I was dissapointed that the improvements were wasted on silly corridors with those annoying silent npcs. </p><p>But when you reach the robot factory and have a hammer the time sails past as your finally having real fun. You\'re meant to do stealth but this game has never done stealth well so I went all in guns a blazing..And died...But had more fun doing so.</p><p>... it\'s a fun good enough dlc But really it needed to be be part of the main game and or be much better to save the franchise.<br> I didn\'t pay much but I would pay more to reward the devs. Maybe as much as 10&#163;&#8364;$. As the sale will likely end soon. </p><p><strong>Oddly enough</strong> I went and checked out dead space remaster and I didn\'t enjoy certain aspects as much as I did in TCP + dlc. So for the first time I\'ll go out on a limb and say not all of DSR is as good as TCP. And as a fan now of both my dream game would be a combination of the two games. </p><p>If you liked TCP then you\'ll love the dlc especially if its cheap. It\'s no blood and wine haha but it\'s a fun extra 3 hrs and gives an ending / closure which kind of kills the hope of a sequel but as we won\'t be getting one...this dlc...does make sense. Its fine...It\'s fun!</p><p>Also I just want to say thank you to the devs. You made a fun game.

I didn\'t really find it necessary for a psyche mechanic, especially since after a couple kills you start to go batshit crazy.</p><p>Con 2 : Probably a me problem, since I have a GTX 1650, but it just seemed so unoptimized.

I don\'t know about that combat wise, they do seem pretty dumb, I hid in a barely clothed bush and put a cap in a NAR soldier\'s head, but a soldier knew that I was behind something.

I had a very close/personal experience with this game, so of course I am biased, but I just want to say that it may be the best viddo game I've ever played. It exceeded my expectations by far. Everything was perfect, from start to finish, I don't think that there was a single thing that I didn't like, the story resolving about time travel, multi-dimensionnal/ worlds, parallel worlds, post-apocalyptic setting, sci-fi, mechas, androids, memories, vessels, consciousness... Those are almost all the tropes I love in fiction, and they perfectly managed to contrusct a story, that would speak to me, like they knew I would say absolutely nothing regarding it. I've never been so much invested in a story, replayed scenes mutiple times, was theorizing all the time etc... Finished in 75h btw, to tell how much I loved it. </p><p>Just 4 hours in, I knew that this game was special, the artstyle... is so immaculate. Those landscapes... Oh my god.... you see that meme in Ratatouille, about Anton Ego flashback ? That was me during the entire game. The landscapes I saw, are the types of landscape I would see IRL once in 10 years, in a urban city. Sorry if it's confusing, like I said, it was a very personal experience and I just can't put words into what they did, other than it was perfect. Thanks to this game, I learned that what I was yearning in a video game was not the gameplay, or the story, nor graphics, but the artstyle/art direction. Like, visual novels, or at least, narrative focused games are not that my type of thing, but this game gets a pass, just for the artstyle.</p><p>Not a single character disliked, I love them all, great character design, and I was rather surprised with the amount characterisation they put into the gameplay, like you really feel Ryoko Shinonome's weakness when the game forces you to take your pills, and calculate every actions you make. Or the fact that Takatoshi Hijiyama, born when WW2 strikes, forced to join the army, and therefore not knowing what is it like to have a normal school, I noticed that among of all the routes, he was the one with the most normal routine for the average highschooler. He's the one character with which you can fully explore the highschool. Cool stuff, not gonna say all things I noticed but I love attention to details like this.</p><p>The music... God. There is one track named : Bittersweet Sorrow, best OST. Never heard something like that, just perfect. First time I heard in game, I think it was during Juro's flashback, when he, Shu Amiguchi and Iori Fuyukasa were cleaning a room when they finished school. Why do I mention this? Well I don't know, I just know that the OST placement was very good... with some highschooler discussing when they're the only ones left in the room at the end of the day, with that beautiful sunset going through the windows... Unflitered work of art.</p><p>Missions are also perfect, very fun, I tried to play in highest difficulty and without resetting the consecutives victories, (67 victories at the end &#128518;) and it showed how much they actually build this system in a way that a bad formation doesn't exist. It's all about how you play.</p><p>Oh and also I played this through Playstation Plus, the game was incredible that I just HAD to buy a physical copy of it. And don't you worry Vanillaware, I've just known you, but I will be buying and playing every single one of your games from now on. Last Nintendo Direct I saw Unicorn Overlord, and thought it was the MVP of the livestream, (because of the artstyle, again! &#128518;) without knowing that it actually was from Vanillaware. Now I know with 13 Sentinels that apparently they can't miss on me. I'm fated to love the shit out of their games. I'm currently playing Odin Sphere, 10 hours in I love it and cannot stop!</p><p>So yeah, here are my impressions after finishing this masterpiece.

My problem was my focus on the middle section. The opening came out swinging with what felt like a lot of promises that weren't kept towards the middle section. The ending section really drives home the overall theme and digs deep into the sentiments. Overall, I really liked FFXVI. In fact I'd probably place it somewhere in my top 10 (that includes alongside things like Tactics, Crystal Chronicles and the MMOs)</p><p>With that, I still feel like there could've been some improvements made. My main gripe is with the lack of backstory and character development with Jill, Joshua, Cid and Mid. Honestly with most of the main cast. Of course these things could be ironed out with DLC, like XV attempted to do. I guess we'll just see there. I think they wanted to do that. The world is vibrant with a lot of backstory, a lot of connections and a lot of political and faction history/motivations. I think it was a problem with funding and time. FFXVI did what it set out to do, and more than anything, I think it's setting up the future blueprint for future Final Fantasy titles. So with that, I want to address the things I liked and disliked. Most of these things go somewhat hand in hand.</p><p>First, the story. I really liked the story. It was short and simple and didn't overcomplicate things. It did take twists that I felt were a bit safe or maybe overly predictable, but it did them well so I can't complain too much. I did think there would be more political intrigue put into the games main narrative, but it never really put too much weight on that. Nothing like XII or Tactics like I was originally expecting. The credit for most of this story goes to the voice cast though. Their performances really personified every aspect of the game. If this game was voiceless, it would honestly have a fairly lackluster story in my opinion. Through the cast, I felt the impacts of their motivations and their grief and their sheer will, unbroken. By the end, I couldn't help but feel sad. In a way, it feels like Ultima convinced me right at the end that our choice was wrong. At the same time, not really. It made me long for Clive to make his way back to Jill. Honestly for everyone to just have their happy ending, because they deserved it. And simply because of the way it made me feel by the end, I have to give credit to the writing, the story, the characters, the voice cast, and even the quests...</p><p>So, while I'm thinking about it. My second point, the quests. I didn't like the quests. But I did like the quests. I know that makes no sense, but I'm mixed on it. The side quests throughout most of the game feel inconsequential and only seemed to build on ideas that just... really weren't that interesting. That's not saying all of them were like that. Far from it. Even the early quests, like the cursed bearer turned to stone next to the mill, or the bearer hunting/fighting with wild packs of dogs and so on. Those were extremely compelling, and I wish the game would've dug more into those darker sides of the world. It shows you these things, but you hardly ever feel like you're making a difference or feel like you're really apart of the problems with the world outside of the main narrative. But that's also the thing... it's so in line with the narrative. You're an outlaw, of course you wouldn't be overly involved. That lack of change is brought up often. Characters questioning if they're doing anything at all. I guess I'd just prefer more of either thing. More diving into the emotional turmoil of their choices, or more emphasis on the changes going on around the continent. Sometimes Clive's and everyone else's will felt too unwavering. It made Ultima's goals always feel unobtainable. I guess though, if you have to kill a god, you'll need that.</p><p>Third, the combat. I loved the combat. In fact I want future Final Fantasy games to follow in inspiration of it. But.... there absolutely needs to be more enemy variety. Granted I put well over 100 hours into the game, so I got to experience most of the enemies multiple times. So it's fair to say I got used to the variety that was there. But I don't think that's it. It really does just need more variety, especially for the hunts. I was going to save hunts for a fourth point, but I'll sum my thoughts up here. The hunts were one of my favorite parts. In fact it's one of my favorite parts about XIV and XII. But I definitely don't think XVI's hunts do nearly as well as either of those games. Most of the fights were just reskins of previous encounters, with a few unique ones as well. I thought that hunts should've been given more unique qualities. The amount of hunts was fine, just not the variety. I realize this is also just my own want, but I would've loved to see some type of bounty system. Something like retrieving bearers from slaver caravans or joining Cursebreakers on missions and so on. Maybe that's just me though...Back to combat though. The way things chain together and the way you can prep magic and attacks ahead of time, felt so nice and fluid. The combat was absolutely masterful. I hope they continue down this route with party member options. Like real time swapping like VII remake. I also love the time stoppage in VII. It allows you to be tactical and select additional moves. Having everything on a hot bar is cool and all, but I felt like there were some major limitations with that. I understand having it though, so you don't completely break the combat. I mean, can you image if we could have every move at our fingertips with multiple hot bar swaps and so on. It would be chaos. I like the prep with certain builds. It adds some personality to Clive that fits your playstyle.</p><p>Damn, I went longer than I meant to, but I wanted to cover my thoughts about it. The thing is. I love Final Fantasy and I loved XVI too. It's been on my mind a lot. About the things I liked and the things I didn't. It's close to what I was hoping for from the game, but not everything I thought it could be. So there's aspects that have left me feeling somewhat disappointed, but overall I can't hate the game. Especially because I want it to do well. I want another Final Fantasy with lots of love put into it. Games can't have everything, but I'm curious. What are some things you wanted to see in the game? What were some things you didn't expect that made their way to the game? or just your general thoughts.</p><p>Long post no one asked for, done.</p>"", 'image': None, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/FFXVI/comments/17n56lv/ive_changed_my_mind_sorta/', 'username': '/u/RinxAika', 'username_url': 'https://www.reddit.com/user/RinxAika', 'created': '2023-11-03T21:10:13Z'}, {'id': 3514344, 'name': 'Outside the obvious Leviathan DLC what else do people want ??', 'text': '<p>Just a general discussion of what other DLC people would want most outside the obvious one (which I am almost positive is happening) </p><p>Would people be open to a DLC possibly set years in the past with different Eikons ?</p>', 'image': None, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/FFXVI/comments/17mwdg9/outside_the_obvious_leviathan_dlc_what_else_do/', 'username': '/u/Red_Emberr', 'username_url': 'https://www.reddit.com/user/Red_Emberr', 'created': '2023-11-03T14:29:12Z'}, {'id': 3514343, 'name': 'If you could, how would you change the last scene of the game?', 'text': '<p>We all know how it ends but I\'ve been sitting here pondering about how it could have been better, in my personal opinion.

Clive says his line ""Can you see it too, Jill."" Then, over the horizon we see Joshua slowly limping over towards Clive with something strapped to his back that we cant quite make out. Joshua leans down and looks at his brothers hand and a tear falls as he picks Clive up off of the ground and starts trekking back to the Hideaway. Then we skip to the Gav/Baby scene with Jill and Torgal looking out at the moon. As the sun rises, Metia fades and before Jill can react we see Joshua rowing ashore with Clive and the sunrise in tow. Torgal howls with immense glee and takes off to the dock, followed by Jill. Joshua is then met by Jill, Torgal, Gav, Otto, and Jote upon coming up the elevator. As they reach the top, we see what it was that Joshua had strapped to his back, it\'s Dion\'s Spear.

It was bad in the original and worse in the remake. When your character eats a hit of a specified amount of damage, they get knocked down, then slowly get back to their feet. That\'s fine, I have no issue, many games do that. What is NOT cool is that I\'m stuck in place while the ""getting back up"" animation plays, and still able to be damaged. So if you get clipped and knocked down, it\'s essentially a guaranteed death because bosses or enemies can wait on you while the player can do nothing to prevent it. Getting killed because the game took control away from the player is awful game design. I could forgive it in the original, it was From\'s first foray into this type of game (3rd person action RPG) but Bluepoint REALLY should have known better. Bloodborne came out in 2015 and it featured a ground dodge mechanic, where the player can dodge back to their feet after being knocked down. The Dark Souls gave you i-frames while the ""getting up"" animation played. When you die in a game it should be because you messed up, it should be a skill issue. Eating hits that aren\'t your fault because the game takes control out of your hands is terrible game design.

So&#8230; I figured that I would offer belated praise for AC: Mirage.</p><p>Here we go! I genuinely enjoyed liked AC: Mirage. I wasn&#8217;t expecting to. It took me more than two years to force myself through AC: Valhalla. Not because it was particularly hard, mind you. I just would get burned out and quit for two to three month intervals, over and over. Too much DEI, too much ESG, too simplistic a parkour system, too shallow a combat system, bla bla bla. Once again, Ubisoft advertised the male version of the hero on the box to boost sales and then made him non-canon in the actual lore, so my whole playthrough was a giant what-if scenario AGAIN. Just lovely.</p><p>I could go on, but I'm getting negative and failing my goal! Moving on! It took me about half a year after launch to will myself to look at AC: Mirage, and I was primed for pure disappointment. Instead, I experienced the exact opposite.</p><p>Sure, it&#8217;s a game based on AC: Valhalla&#8217;s code/systems with a tight budget, but Ubisoft's developers did an awful lot with what they had available. In no particular order:</p><p>I&#8217;d recommend AC: Mirage to people. Indeed, I have recommended it! It felt like a course correction. Granted, I know it wasn&#8217;t a course correction at all. It was more of a side dalliance before Ubisoft doubles down on all of AC: Valhalla&#8217;s mis-steps in AC: Shadows (which I will not be buying until it is on a steep, STEEP, STEEEEEEP discount).</p><p>But you know what? Whatever. Point being, I&#8217;m glad that I buckled down and played this game. I&#8217;m happy that Assassin's Creed: Mirage exists, and I&#8217;m grateful to have experienced it. I hope it did well enough to justify more side dalliances in the future. I&#8217;d love a 20 to 30 hour romp with Bayek, or a 20 to 30 hour sojourn with Shay in the Indian Ocean, or more time with beloved Adewale. Not every game needs to follow the Witcher&#8217;s Creed mold of vast bloated open worlds, vast bloated budgets, and bended knee to SBI.</p><p>But there&#8217;s me getting negative, again. Thanks for the memories here! Genuinely one of my favorite games from 2023, and I&#8217;ll think back on it fondly.</p><p>Edit addition: in fact, and I know this will sound excessive, this was probably my favorite game release of 2023.

So it's like PES will select my icon again when it's passed to another player. On PES 17, i could guarantee that when I made a pass, it would be my friend who received it, every time. But every game since, a lot of the time I'll make a pass, and it'll just end up being me who receives it again. Any idea why this would be happening?</p>"", 'image': None, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/WEPES/comments/17lhfbm/co_op_issue/', 'username': '/u/SoupRemarkable8939', 'username_url': 'https://www.reddit.com/user/SoupRemarkable8939', 'created': '2023-11-01T17:29:43Z'}, {'id': 3513477, 'name': 'Help with playing pes 21 with updated squads and kits.', 'text': '<p>I stil own pes 21!

This wasn't as extreme as some examples, but the gameplay doesn't feel great.

Smeagol was known for his split personality, constantly at odds with himself. His alter ego, Gollum, resided within him, a dark and twisted reflection of his once innocent self. Despite their differences, Smeagol and Gollum found themselves united in their opinion about a recently released video game called ""The Lord of the Rings: Gollum.""</p><p>One sunny day, a renowned interviewer from the Shire Times arrived to conduct an exclusive interview with Smeagol and Gollum about the game. The pair sat on a rocky ledge near the Great River, their minds filled with anticipation. The interviewer cleared his throat and began the interview.</p><p>Interviewer: ""Greetings, Smeagol and Gollum! Today, we\'re here to discuss \'The Lord of the Rings: Gollum\' video game. Smeagol, I understand you quite enjoyed the game. What are your thoughts?""</p><p>Smeagol\'s eyes twinkled with excitement as he spoke, his voice a mixture of enthusiasm and innocence.</p><p>Smeagol: ""Oh, precious game! Fun it was, yes! Underrated, it is! Smeagol enjoyed every moment, sneaking through the dark, treacherous landscapes of Middle-earth. The game captures the essence of our beloved world. We felt like we were back on our adventures, searching for the precious, battling with our inner demons.""</p><p>Gollum, however, scowled and hissed, his voice filled with disdain.</p><p>Gollum: ""Lies! Filthy lies! The game was nothing but a miserable failure, just like precious Bilbo! Hates it, we do! The graphics were dull, the controls were clunky, and the gameplay, oh, don\'t get me started! Too much sneaking, not enough precious, yes!""</p><p>Smeagol tried to calm his alter ego, pleading for a fair evaluation of the game.</p><p>Smeagol: ""No, no, Gollum! Be fair, precious! The game had its flaws, but it immersed us in the world we love. We journeyed through Cirith Ungol, the dreaded Mirkwood, and even faced the towering Barad-d&#251;r. The struggle with our split personality added depth to the gameplay.""</p><p>Gollum snarled, his eyes gleaming with anger.</p><p>Gollum: ""Depth, you say? Bah! We battled with ourselves every step of the way, making it frustrating and tiresome. And the glitches, oh, the glitches! The game froze, characters disappeared, and we got stuck in walls, precious! It was a disaster, and we\'ll never forgive it!""</p><p>The interviewer, fascinated by the dynamic between Smeagol and Gollum, pressed further.</p><p>Interviewer: ""What about the voice acting? I\'ve heard it was a highlight of the game. Did you find it enjoyable?""</p><p>Smeagol\'s face lit up with genuine delight.</p><p>Smeagol: ""Yes, yes, precious! The voice acting was a ray of sunshine in the darkness. The actors brought our characters to life, and we felt a connection to them. It was like listening to the echoes of our past adventures.""</p><p>Gollum begrudgingly nodded, acknowledging this one positive aspect of the game.</p><p>Gollum: ""Yes, the voices were... acceptable. But that doesn\'t change the fact that the rest of the game was a wretched mess! The controls were as clumsy as our goblin captors, and the outdated game design made us feel like we were trapped in the past.""</p><p>Smeagol interjected, his voice filled with a glimmer of hope.</p><p>Smeagol: ""But Gollum, my dear, stubborn friend, we mustn\'t overlook the potential this game holds. It takes us on a journey through our own tumultuous history, allowing players to experience the conflict within ourselves. And perhaps, with future updates and improvements, it could become the precious gem it was meant to be.""</p><p>Gollum grumbled and crossed his arms, but a flicker of curiosity danced in his eyes.</p><p>Gollum: ""Improvements, you say? Maybe, just maybe, they can salvage the game from its pitiful state. But it will take more than a few updates to win me over, precious. I demand perfection!""</p><p>The interviewer chuckled, sensing the unique blend of camaraderie and rivalry between Smeagol and Gollum.</p><p>Interviewer: ""Thank you both for sharing your passionate views on \'The Lord of the Rings: Gollum.\' It seems like this game has ignited quite a debate within your dual personalities. Your conflicting opinions only serve to highlight the complex nature of the character you both embody. Perhaps, in time, this game will find its way into the hearts of fans, just like your story did.""</p><p>Smeagol and Gollum glanced at each other, their eyes meeting for a brief moment of understanding. The tale of their divided selves continued, not only in the game but in their ongoing journey through Middle-earth.</p><p>And so, the interview concluded, leaving behind a trail of intrigue and curiosity. Smeagol and Gollum, forever intertwined in their shared existence, would continue to explore the realms of fantasy and engage in heated debates over the merits of games, stories, and the preciousness of life itself.""</p>', 'image': None, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/LOTRGollum/comments/14269qj/chatgpt_gollum_and_smeagol_give_an_interview_on/', 'username': '/u/pennylessz', 'username_url': 'https://www.reddit.com/user/pennylessz', 'created': '2023-06-06T06:28:13Z'}, {'id': 3504087, 'name': 'Need help finding specific video', 'text': '<p>I saw a video on Reddit earlier today where you can see orcs walking in the background across a bridge.

I checked everywhere it could\'ve been including way back machine snapshots of the call of duty YouTube channel. It\'s definitely not on YouTube (or at least the original media was not uploaded there. It is possible someone has uploaded a video of it but I\'ve also not been able to find anything.

Going there on the way back machine shows the welcome page but the ""enter"" button is not functional.</p><p>I specifically remember the audio part where there was some sort of classical music or something that sounded like it was on a record player, very old sounding. This music would be cut off abruptly and then you\'d hear beeping sounds which I am confident was Morse code. After the beeps stopped, the music would start playing again shortly after.</p><p>unfortunately I do not remember what the video portion of this media was. It was a long time ago after all but the audio definitely stuck with me for its very eerie tone and vibe. </p><p>There are a lot of videos showing the number of nova 6 transmissions that were likely part of this ARG but none of them have the specific audio I am looking for.</p><p>I\'ve accepted that the original media is likely gone with this being an ARG but I\'m hoping someone, somewhere has something and if they don\'t, maybe someone at least remembers this.

The addition of some FRECA drivers, F1A and even F4 if they're part of another teams affliate program is awesome. It does leave me with some questions though.</p><p>What I'm curious about though is if other teams can also 'poach' drivers from your affliate program and add them to their own affliate programs? I have seen multiple videos from content creators about it but haven't seen them touch that subject yet. But that would be a huge feature for the longetivity of the career mode if they added it. Has anyone seen anything about that from the YT videos released about it?</p><p>I'm also very curious how they'll handle Red Bull's junior program. Let's say you manage one of the big three (Red Bull, Ferrari, Merc.) Would Toro Rosso/VCARB have a separate academy from Red Bull and would they be able to promote drivers mid-season, unlike other teams are able to? And what about Ferrari en Merc, would they be able to develop affliate drivers at 'smaller' teams associated with them (Haas, Williams) before getting them to the big leagues, or would the affliate drivers have to stay on the sidelines in F2/F3 the whole time while waiting for their chance with a big team? Because that would be a bit unrealistic.</p><p>Thoughts?

There were quite a lot of one-off mutations that didn't get much use outside of single caves or temples, but I feel almost everything has the potential to be expanded on. Just off the top of my head, I'd love to see more dark caves so glowy skin can shine (literally lol), suction feet enabling vertical climbing, statues you can move around to fight enemies, and a bigger variety of critters that are enchanted by your musical ability and / or shiny crystal and will help you to various things, from carrying food to helping fight off things attacking you.</p><p>The ability to issue simple commands to pack mates. I talked about this a bit in another post, but even something as simple as a STAY HERE command would be literally game changing! Having pack mates stupidly follow you into lava filled areas and burn themselves to death or having your cool camouflage mutation go to waste because you've only got one copy of it and the rest of your pack right behind you is still visible and edible isn't very fun. Being able to tell some of them to stay still would enable safer exploration and experimentation and open up more puzzle options, too (imagine having to split your team and have one half work in one place while the other has to operate a mechanism in another, for example). The risk of predators or perhaps trebhum being able to start wandering off and need to be recruited again if left alone for too long would add a nice balance to this! </p><p>Better options for inventory management! I always had to stop a lot to move things around, and one of the biggest offenders was trying to suck up food in a place with lots of varieties and ending up with like 2 each of three different things blocking me from getting other more abundant foods on offer. Perhaps a mutation or even an innate trebhum ability where food of all varieties can be digested into just a general food stuff, taking up less slots?</p><p>Another idea I had, separate from the base game, is that multiplayer could be pretty cool. This could be either couch co-op or maybe something Journey-esque where you could enable random players to join you in your world.

It&#8217;s been months of hard work and getting funded in a matter of hours means a lot to us. We were confident about it, and as a token of gratitude, let&#8217;s take a look at some of the most important stretch goals we prepared for our lovely community.</p><p>The campaign for this cyberpunk platformer hides tons of surprises, including both physical rewards and extra in-game content. You&#8217;re about to learn about the first two, one that includes more gameplay options, and the other focused on getting a more immersive experience &#8230; Excited enough?</p><p><strong>New tier reward</strong></p><p>It is an expansion of the Level A Ghost (+Physical) tier but adding a digital copy of Eden Genesis for Steam. The new tier is called &#8220;Level A Ghost Plus (+Physical)&#8221;, and it has been created thanks to the feedback from the community on social media.</p><p>Thanks for your constant suggestions and contributions to the project! If you want to access this new reward at an incredible price, visit <a href=""https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/aeternumgamestudios/eden-genesis-a-cyberpunk-adventure/rewards#reward-UmV3YXJkLVVtVjNZWEprTFRrNE9ESTROek09"">this link</a>.</p><p><strong>First stretch goal, a replay and practice mode</strong></p><p>Each trial in Eden Genesis is different from the last, presenting a unique level design and enemy presence. Your ultimate goal is achieving the best score by eliminating all hostile entities, cleaning the SND and keeping your synchro levels at maximum.</p><p>Thanks to this stretch goal you can practice adding your own checkpoints to familiarize yourself with the level. The training mode will allow you to perfect your reflexes and marks when you come to a test that seems too complex or in which you do not obtain the expected results.</p><p>By being able to add and remove checkpoints at will, you will not need to repeat the entire level. Focus on that section that you are struggling with, and practice as much as you want until you are completely familiar with the enemy layout and platform design.</p><p><strong>Second stretch goal, dubbing</strong></p><p>Eden Genesis is more than a fast-paced platformer, it also features a deep story and in order to make it more immersive, we aim to get full English dubbing for in-game dialogues.</p><p>Wish to know more? As soon as the first stretch goal is done, we&#8217;ll share more details about it&#8230;</p><p>Once again, thank you so much for your support.

It\'s complicated but it\'s clearly inaccurate. For large plane changes manual is best but 2 step plane changes with planner can be accurately ""completed"".', 'text': ""<p>I first wanted to set up appropriate test conditions, my test altitude was 80km. This will make calculations some what easier. While you might think this is easy, there is a caveot. </p><p>KSP2 appears to have an orbital bug. While my ship had no power, no rcs (its a lander) and RCS off. The orbit was increasing altitude, and not steadilly but in jumps of 5 to 10 meters at a time. If I achieved a nearly perfect orbit, you would see AP and PE suddenly jump. </p><p>Anyway I performed the test without the manuever planner. The results were not good. Despite the fact my smallish craft had two small reaction wheel stabilizers . I was suppose to spend 948 d/v to achieve a 24.6 degree change in inclination, I instead used 985. Moreover, my apoapsis increases from r = 680,000 to 716132. I cannot even tell you if the dV data that was given was correct, since I calculated 1058.59 dV was supposed to be used and I used 985. </p><p>So, I decided this ain't going well at all, I changed the poodle engine for a vector engine which has a notoriously insane gimble. In this test I went to 30.3 degrees, I started with 1688 dV and 0' inclination relative to the mun. I ended up with 484 dV, I calculated I needed 1204 (2278* 30.3' * 2 * pi /360' and the difference is exactly 1204. Ok so that sounds all good. The major axis did not change length. </p><p>So two problems.<br> -Orbit is hopping up around 80,000 for no reason. Its still happening with the vector engine.<br> -The dV calculated is not the dV used and the major axis changes. That problem is specific to the poodle engine. Ergo, the engine is not a reliable way to change planes. With or without the maneuver planner. </p><p>Maneuver planner has problems. </p><p>So next I tried to set the orbit back to zero in a single step. Is this going to work.<br> So as I approached 1% (from 30%) on the maneuver planner the projected orbit started expanding, so I gave it some retrograde, I eventually go the planner to circularize the orbit, but still no less than 0.9% and exactly the dV I needed to create the inclination. </p><p>So I set up and do my burn, which is 4.2% shy of the desired plane and on a rock solid reentry course. Not good. </p><p>So what do I think is happening. the change plane is a line that goes between the current and desired plane. It represents two opposing points on the orbit. However, dV is a process that requires time. Lets think about what 1 degree is. 1 degree is what Period divided by 360 degrees. Period is 2 * pi * SQRT(r^3 /mu) =31.3 minutes (1876 seconds). A degree is 5.2 seconds. </p><p>OK so with 1204 dV required to change 30.3 degrees of plane change over how many seconds are we changing planes if our engine can generate a generous 30 m/s^2 of acceleration. That requires 40 seconds. So that our position relative to the point starts 20 seconds or 4 degrees before and ends 4 degrees after. However the acceleration is not constant, there is higher acceleration after the PC point than before. As a consequence we might wish to alter the plane change point 1 to 2 degree before the PC point. </p><p>So the maneuver planner is showing the path, a curve you ship will take to reach a desired coordinate. If you start the maneuver exactly at the point it will flatten the plane well after, you start a bit before then it flattens out to the point. I managed to get it to 0.2 degrees. But the curve elliptical was bloated.<br> So no pro/retrograde (ignoring the line plot) this time just burning according to the planner. Que sera, sera. So after burning the allotted 23 seconds I exactly passed the desired plane and reached an undesired plane of 5.3 degrees tilt. Had I calculated the dV needed (1195) and stopped at that dV the plane change would have been nearly perfect. Instead I needed and additional 208 dV to return to the desired plane and lost 208 dV overshooting the plane for a total loss of 416 dV. </p><p>SO I then decided to break the burn up into two parts. So I created an inclined orbit of 30.5'. I presupposed that controlling the burn time on the low end would be very difficult. Consequently, I took the square root of the angle which was 5.5. I then subtracted 5.5 from 30.5 giving a change of plane of 25 degrees. and secondarily 5.5 degrees. So the manuever planner was used to set the angle, I got it to 6.3 degrees instead of 5.5. This burn was performed exactly according to the planner, it used 1066 dV instead of the planners 1031, however the result was not 6.1 but 3.6'. The next burn from 3.6 to zero went exactly by the planner, the result was the expected 0' and 150 dV.<br> So how is dV in the two burn. The expected dV required was 1214, the used dV was 1216. The difference between the suggested dV in the first burn of 1031 and the actual according to the burn guidance of 1066 is 35. The difference expected was 99' so that is kind of strange, but I suspect that the variance between 99 and 35 has to do with maneuvers's expected expansion of the orbit which did not happen. </p><p>So the conclusion.<br> Can the Maneuver Planner accurately plan out large plane changes? No.<br> Can one modify it to accurately plan burns. Its less of a modification than a splint and crutches.<br> However knowing that plane changes only require orthogonal thrust along the normal and limiting the planner to normal vectors will prevent radial variances in the burns.<br> As noted above in two burns, one of 30 degrees that was overshot by 5.3 degrees and the other of 24.5 degrees that overshot by 2.7 degrees, the error in plane changes increases markedly past 20'. whereas the error in changes less than 5 degrees is negligible. </p><p>Recommendation. Understand the acceleration of your craft, determine manually the dV reguired to make a plane change. Anticipate acceleration at the end of the burn. Determine the burn time based of average dV and acceleration. Cut the burn time in half and start just a little before, and burn until desired plane change occurs.<br> You can use the Manuever planner for plane changes but be aware that its error is astonomical with respect to the delta-theta. If you anticipate this you can do much of the change with the planner and then finish the burn manually or during the next orbit.</p>"", 'image': None, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/kerbalspaceprogram_2/comments/12msy0h/is_there_a_maneuver_planner_error_its_complicated/', 'username': '/u/Sphinxer553', 'username_url': 'https://www.reddit.com/user/Sphinxer553', 'created': '2023-04-15T06:40:45Z'}, {'id': 3439676, 'name': 'State of the Game patch 2', 'text': '<p>Hey Kerbal Engineers!

I have been trying to make sense of the story and give myself an enclosure. Otherwise, I will need a shrinker soon at this rate.</p><p>I need help figuring out where Max gets her power so I can understand the sources of the storm, which might help make sense of the story and the torturous endings. However, I realize even devs mightn\'t know the story clearly. The more I dig in, the less sense I make. The story is like a sieve leaking everywhere.</p><p>Many posts here provide details I missed when I played the game, but those details make it more challenging to understand the story. I think devs either have no idea what they are doing or don\'t bother (or need more resources) to tell us the whole story. They leave loose ends everywhere.</p><p>Some details indeed imply it is Prescotts, not Max causes the storm. It doesn\'t surprise me that no one can verify it. Devs keep us guessing around. Some posts argue that the reason for the disappearing storm in the ""Sacrifice Chloe"" ending is Nathan getting arrested on the first day so that he can\'t ""do"" something we don\'t know and cause the storm happens in 4 days. In all other timelines, Nathan is neutralized only after Monday.</p><p>It is far-fetched; nothing tells us about Nathan\'s conspiracy on Monday explicitly. This hypothesis created many more questions, Though it dodges the apparent paradox that we can\'t take Jefferson down and avoid the storm simultaneously if the storm is caused by Max\'s rewind.</p><p>The most decisive question should be: what are his motives? Why would Prescotts want to destroy the very town they suck blood from? I never heard of killing the customers being good for sale. It can\'t explain Max\'s visions either. If Max\'s power didn\'t cause the storm, Max would NOT have had those visions. Why would she? She has nothing to do with it in this case. Furthermore, If Nathan had a big plan on Monday, why would he go to the girl\'s room with a gun to meet someone who blackmailed him? Wouldn\'t it be better to postpone it to Friday?</p><p>I used to be excited when I learned from some posts that Racheal might have granted the power to Max, and I like this idea. Racheal wants Max to take her place as the best friend or lover; she gives Max the power and vision to save Chloe and finally leave Acadia Bay together as she planned to do with Chloe. Especially, devs confirm that the doe Max sees often is Racheal communicating with her spirit animal. Other disturbing details also imply the connection between Racheal and the doe(It is too sad/painful to recall it). But crediting the storm to Racheal also brings us a lot of questions. (I haven\'t played Before the Storm; It is too scary to run that game even though it lies in my Steam library; I don\'t want to see any more suffering, at least recently )</p><p>Why does Racheal want to destroy Acadia Bay? What she had been through had nothing to do with the people of Acadia Bay. Why would she create a storm to threaten innocent people, her family, and her beloved Chloe? It makes no sense, though I really like the implications of this theory. Furthermore, if Racheal intends to save Chloe with Max\'s help, why would the storm disappear in the ""sacrifice Chloe ending?"" Wouldn\'t it be a storm plus an earthquake and plus a tsunami?</p><p>Anyway, it is exhausting to hang on like this. The devs hide/make up too much content on purpose and leave the story ambiguous. Well, As far as I know, it could be an efficient marketing strategy: controversiality. I have been depressed for more than a week.

But what else makes Isonzo stand out?</p><p>Since our first game <a href=""https://store.steampowered.com/app/242860/Verdun/"">Verdun</a>, we\'ve been committed to bringing history to life in a way that reflects something of the real WW1 experience. Uniforms and weapons are carefully recreated based on research and reference materials (including actually firing many of the guns in-game), and most of the time you\'ll be using a bolt-action rifle rather than the machine guns or prototype handguns that flood the battlefields in a lot of WW1 games. Of course we have machine guns, sniper rifles, rifle grenades, and other weapon types, but they\'re generally linked to specific classes or map specific heavy weapons rather than being available for anyone. This also means that melee combat takes center stage when you get into close quarters, for the same reasons it often did in real life.</p><p><a href=""https://preview.redd.it/gyqzt2vd21vc1.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d706b434e0cb319c10db9d8dbfdefb8f63553a3"">https://preview.redd.it/gyqzt2vd21vc1.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d706b434e0cb319c10db9d8dbfdefb8f63553a3</a></p><p><a href=""https://preview.redd.it/7ys6fane21vc1.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5cca117310f2422c6d62a78d2b2d096a5b7e16dd"">https://preview.redd.it/7ys6fane21vc1.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5cca117310f2422c6d62a78d2b2d096a5b7e16dd</a></p><p>This doesn\'t mean that Isonzo is trying to be a playable war documentary. It\'s a game, and we always keep gameplay in mind. Maps are based on real photos, drawings, and trench maps - but compressed where necessary so you aren\'t walking for 15 minutes between objectives and to maintain variety. You can see how we use reference material in the comparison shots below: </p><p><a href=""https://preview.redd.it/hsshku9g21vc1.jpg?width=2454&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=574d3682e6bc3b00e1d0cde254135f0b2aceb92d"">https://preview.redd.it/hsshku9g21vc1.jpg?width=2454&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=574d3682e6bc3b00e1d0cde254135f0b2aceb92d</a></p><p><a href=""https://preview.redd.it/70i87v9g21vc1.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1bc46bd2b2e0310a3a7a7bfb7bb187e20657fa9b"">https://preview.redd.it/70i87v9g21vc1.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1bc46bd2b2e0310a3a7a7bfb7bb187e20657fa9b</a></p><p><a href=""https://preview.redd.it/2seu0v9g21vc1.jpg?width=1720&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=004454d1d8b652f2a8d5828b85a25a02fa4fe3e3"">https://preview.redd.it/2seu0v9g21vc1.jpg?width=1720&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=004454d1d8b652f2a8d5828b85a25a02fa4fe3e3</a></p><p>Many of Isonzo\'s battles are set in or around the mountains of the Alps. To represent these accurately we had to design maps with a lot of variation in heights - for instance this early part of the Dolomites Offensive where the attackers must storm clifftop trenches:</p><p><a href=""https://i.redd.it/gd2reanh21vc1.gif"">https://i.redd.it/gd2reanh21vc1.gif</a></p><p>In a lot of FPS games height differences are limited to two story buildings or gentle hills, but we needed a more epic scale for Isonzo. <strong>If you skip ahead to 1:30</strong> <a href=""https://youtu.be/Dp-luYJhe4w?si=FF2FVduNQeuoSzpO&amp;t=90"">in this Sabotino map flyover video</a><strong>, you see how it transitions from a mountaintop objective to sweep down into the valley and bridge.</strong> While defenders are usually the ones occupying the high ground, in this map you fight your way up the mountain and then down the other side, giving the unusual experience of defending from below. Watch out for grenades...</p><p><a href=""https://preview.redd.it/vmve600t51vc1.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c0c90f44b1dd7b96e6c59ac7fc92e0f277316e35"">Looking down onto the bridge from Monte Sabotino.</a></p><p>The clothing and styles of the 1910s were far more varied than what you see in a lot of FPS games with a modern setting. During the war things progressed quickly as armies moved away from the more colorful uniforms of the last century and towards plainer, simpler uniforms that provided better camouflage. There was also a lot of variety, with less of the standardization seen with modern militaries. Last but not least, mustaches were in fashion - and what fashion!</p><p><a href=""https://preview.redd.it/iviax9ov41vc1.jpg?width=2659&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f28f84eb43e7165c542ae74dab277eb298765c7d"">Facial hair in descending order of size.</a></p><p>In Isonzo we represent a wide variety of the clothing and accessories that troops might have worn on the frontlines. Uniforms and headgear are all linked to the different classes in the game to maintain that historical authenticity we mentioned earlier, while facial hair and items like glasses or smoking pipes can be used with any class. Players can expand their selection through our paid cosmetic DLCs which focus on specific themes, like veteran troops or high altitude cold weather gear. These DLCs are only visual, and we don\'t lock any gameplay features or updates behind them.</p><p>We\'ve already released a number of free updates for Isonzo with new maps, weapons, and even a whole new faction... and we\'re not done. There are more maps and weapons coming, alongside additional paid cosmetic DLC packs.</p><p><a href=""https://preview.redd.it/9oj815ow41vc1.jpg?width=3840&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=891444b944082f01cac44efcc530bf183c926b1f"">https://preview.redd.it/9oj815ow41vc1.jpg?width=3840&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=891444b944082f01cac44efcc530bf183c926b1f</a></p>', 'image': 'https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/1PtwMhs6xQWgeO10cnafwPhiyZZILHuDmAHyNNgs0_Q.jpg', 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/WW1GameSeries/comments/1c68f5i/heres_why_you_should_check_out_isonzo_in_the/', 'username': '/u/VerdunGame', 'username_url': '', 'created': '2024-04-17T12:21:18Z'}, {'id': 3546223, 'name': 'Could Ascentbe permanent?', 'text': ""<p>Do you think there is any chance that the devs will leave Ascent in?

Before I list WHY I think Happy\'s Humble Burger Farm leans right politically, I\'m going to state that obviously I\'m a big fan of this game. I\'m not trying to ""cancel"" the devs, and in fact I hope there\'s a sequel, because this game was so fun. However, the more I listened to the radio programming in the simulation, the more I became convinced of the game\'s not so subtle political leanings. Here are some examples:</p><p>1: Not in the radio programming, but in the cutscene flashback, the villain explains that with the Lucidus Initiative, they will be able to ""shift cultural norms"" and ""fortify elections."" The term fortify elections is especially telling, as this term only entered the public zeitgeist after the 2020 election, when the media started talking about fortifying the election to protect it from Trump and the rights meddling. Trump, eager to claim the election was stolen from him, claimed that the term was code for rigging the election. The term ""fortify elections"" was therefore regarded as a good thing by the left, but regarded as evil by the right. Happy\'s Humble Burger Farm is the first non-explicitly right wing place where I\'ve seen the term used negatively. </p><p>At first I thought this might have just been a coincidence, maybe the devs heard the term and for fun put it in the game with a sinister connotation. If this was the only evidence I had, I wouldn\'t be making this thread. </p><p>2: But then there was the scene where you\'re captured and the evil scientists start ranting against talk radio. They call it garbage and express satisfaction that it\'s banned on the island. Now, obviously they\'re not talking about radio stations that play music, they\'re referring to political talk radio. In real life, political and conspiracy talk radio leans overwhelmingly right-wing. People like Alex Jones and the late Rush Limbaugh became infamous through their attacks on all things progressive in America, while urging their followers to vote Republican. Alex Jones is also responsible for the vile conspiracy that the Sandy Hook shooting was staged, and the parents of the dead children were crisis actors. So obviously, in real life liberals/leftists would call talk radio garbage. Yet in Happy\'s, it is the villains who hate talk radio. </p><p>After those two pieces of evidence, I started listening to the optional radio programming in the simulation, of which there are over two hours of content. Much of it leans to the far right. Here are a few more examples:</p><p>3: One radio host taunts social media platforms for including a ""pink triangle"" for ""spreading misinformation."" This is obviously meant to attack Twitter for its policy of putting a pink triangle over right-wing covid denialism content or content that claims Trump won the election. While currently, Twitter is owned by the right-wing Elon Musk, when Happy\'s was made, Twitter was run by liberals and the pink was mainly attacked by conservatives.</p><p>4: There is a long segment about an anti-video game crusader who eventually gets a heart attack and dies after playing the games he tried to ban for so long. At first, this man seems like the kind of quack job that both the left and the right can hate, the kind of person who would that games cause school shootings or lead people to Satan, etc. But as the story proceeds, we find out what the man is truly concerned about is that the games he is campaigning against are ""neo-nazi, neo-fascist propaganda."" He also goes on to say there are political dimensions to all artwork. In my point of view, this segment is one of the stronger pieces of evidence that Happy\'s has a right-wing point of view.

It is usable, and I can manage, but very very frustrating for me to navigate. I just wanted to post some suggestions in hopes that the devs will read this and take these points into consideration.</p><p>I also want to state that I want this game to get better, be fun, and something that is a good experience overall. So, here are my suggestions for controller changes for the UI and I hope that these make sense as I am trying my best to write everything out. Also, I am in no way posting here to bash, hate, or talk bad about the game or the developers. I just want to contribute and help make the game better for the players.</p><p>Now with all that out of the way, lets get into it!</p><p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong> <em>There may be more ideas coming up to mind that I might update this post later, but here are some that stand out to me the most.</em></p><p>The Controller UI functionality is not streamlined and acts different in various windows that supposed to do the same thing.</p><p>For example, while in the pause menu -&gt; Options, you can scroll with the dpad as well as the left stick, but it makes it very hard to select a button/option unless you use the cursor. While in the player inventory, the Dpad and the left stick moves from item to item but does not scroll.</p><p>Scrolling functionality should be the same in every UI window, so it is less confusing for the player. Its almost like learning something and trying to do the same thing but it works differently than you have already learned.</p><p>I hope the UI functionality could get more streamlined so its less frustrating for the player.</p><p>These controls will be for the Nintendo Switch Controller as that is what I am playing on currently.</p><p><strong>Right stick</strong> - Move cursor.</p><p><strong>Left stick</strong> - Scrolls while cursor is hovered over scrollable areas.</p><p><strong>D-pad</strong> - Selection (moving from one inventory item to the next, or one button to the next button).</p><p><strong>B button</strong> - Cancel.</p><p><strong>A button</strong> - Confirm/Interact.</p><p><strong>RB/LB</strong> - Sub-tabs(Inventory item types (Food, Weapons, Quest Items, etc...)).</p><p><strong>ZR/ZL</strong> - Main Tabs (Character Skills, Quest Log, Map, etc...).</p><p>When the cursor is <strong><em>HOVERING</em></strong> over a scrollable area, the left stick will allow scrolling <strong>ONLY</strong> on what is being hovered over. The Dpad will allow the selectable elements such as buttons or items to be selected such as moving up and down a list of items in the inventory.</p><p>When using the Dpad in the UI menus, all character functionality should not work, such as opening and closing the map, using a potion, etc...</p><p>The whole page could be managed with the dpad, moving from one button/interaction box to another. The cursor could be hidden until moved with right thumbstick and the left stick can scroll the scrollable area.</p><p>When the player interacts with a NPC, Sign, or even an object that prompts a dialog box. HIDE the cursor. There are already button inputs in place to accept, back, or cancel whatever is popping up on screen. There is no need for the cursor. <strong><em>(I know this is a minor suggestion, but still one none the less).</em></strong></p><p><strong>Cursor:</strong> Can hide cursor when not moving with right stick. Hides cursor after a couple seconds. (Cursor still needed for hovering over stats for tool tips).</p><p>This window can be managed with the dpad to move, equip or etc... with the items. Having the cursor always visible can cause some bugs which I have ran into already. <strong><em>(I will not get into this as this posting is just for suggestions)</em></strong><strong>.</strong></p><p>This is only looking at the item selection in the inventory.</p><p><strong>X button</strong> to bring up options with that item (Split, Discard, Use) and the Dpad to scroll up and down those different options.</p><p>&#8203;</p><p><a href=""https://preview.redd.it/m3vj30tinz6c1.jpg?width=293&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5a4a37ceab6bc2877888691ac7d7c603ce209e9a"">UI Prompt on an individual item when selected</a></p><p><strong>B button</strong> will exit out of that item UI prompt and back to the inventory.</p><p><strong>A button</strong> will interact with the item by picking it up.</p><p><strong>Y button</strong> can split items quickly by bringing the prompt up for it. Or it can quickly equip an item swapping the currently equipped item with the new one. <strong><em>(Either functionality I would go for personally).</em></strong></p><p>Can hide cursor when not moving with right stick. Hides cursor after a couple seconds after becoming visible.</p><p>This whole window can be selected/interacted with the Dpad. Move the dpad to the skill you want to upgrade, select that skill, and off to the right you can choose what you want to upgrade on that skill that is currently selected.</p><p>Not sure why the cursor appears here also, it is not needed as all the button inputs are visible and shown. Might as well hide the players cursor all together to get rid of unnecessary UI elements. <strong><em>(Cursor not shown in picture, I couldn\'t capture one for the posting).</em></strong></p><p>&#8203;</p><p><a href=""https://preview.redd.it/fadrimqfnz6c1.jpg?width=677&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=03160c587fdf0d0f0675e3161e4bcf22510236bd"">https://preview.redd.it/fadrimqfnz6c1.jpg?width=677&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=03160c587fdf0d0f0675e3161e4bcf22510236bd</a></p><p>Currently there is no key binding VISIBLE to know what button to press to use the potion.

There is a confirmation SFX that is played and I love that feedback.</p><p>When <strong>scrolling</strong> up or down a page of text, maybe some subtle scrolling audio would be nice as well.</p><p>The game overall is pretty fun to play, with controller functionality that needs to be more polished. I hope that the devs will work on the controller support and UI functionality <strong><em>(and bugs of course)</em></strong> since I love this game and have had a great time playing it.</p><p>I know there is probably a ton more ideas or even better ones than what I have written up already.

I should not be getting locked up by budget Curry ffs. </p><p>&#8226;Shooting. 2k look, I get the timing variation, it makes sense, but it is TOO much for people that don't have a whole ass gaming setup and dedicated Internet connection for gaming and 2k. Make the green window smaller if you have too, make it as hard as you want to shoot, but please stop with this varying shot speed. I shoot roughly 50% from 3 and I'm STILL constantly blindsided by a super fast or super slow jumpshot that makes no sense whatsoever. </p><p>&#8226;Animation requirements need to be changed. Rather it's dunk animations, dribbling animations, etc. All of these meta animations need higher thresholds to be met. The second best dribble move in this game only requires an 83 ball handle while the worst contact dunk requires an 87 dunk despite driving dunk being one of the most expensive attributes in the builder.

Even though it was a mecha game it played much more like your typical multiplayer survival shooter, tarkov style game. The anime had chassis-mounted shoulder missiles. The game had throwable grenades you\'d find in ammo crates. And of the stylistic pieces (map design, art assets, etc.) though I could sense some effort, the passion was really missing compared to the anime, and they were focusing on all the wrong things (like having the main progression system be a house that you can\'t interact with and can only watch your virtual waifu do things as a menu screensaver, and not being able to visually customize your robot outside of pre-painted parts).</p><p>So imagine my shock when shortly after the beta finished I found the trailer for SandLand, which, even in just the brief trailer preview, mogged Synduality (the game) in every single way. It was actually focused on the robots, with robust customization and painting. The map was amazing. There was actual character progression and story. It even had actual housing. And although at the time I didn\'t know there was an anime (I\'d read the manga a few years earlier) I was also coincidentally going through a Toriyama binge and was delighted to hear that SandLand was getting one. Basically, the game came at a perfect time for me, and I can say that I think it captures the essence of the show, the fantasy, and the world that Toriyama created near perfectly. You can tell the love that went into everything in this game.</p><p>Sandland\'s map is a work of art. I think that being required to recreate the paneling of the manga and the cinematography of anime forced the mapmakers to consider procession and visual framing much more than other open world titles. While the map is open world, unlike something like Horizon Forbidden West there are hard barriers which separate the map into sections and have predetermined egress points. This allows the developers to control what players focus on as they enter zones and to draw their eyes to certain features, even across whole zones. For example, the Lisab Battleship is prominently visible across the entirety of the Sand Land. And there are a lot of places that you see in the distance or behind a cliff or will think are a part of the skybox/set design that you actually end up traveling to. For example, if you travel back through an area that was part of a cinematic before, you\'ll find a side path that takes you to a place with cool rocks. There is no purpose to the location other than being cool, and there are many places like that. There are also many different shortcuts from zone to zone through random/hidden areas that you wouldn\'t think to explore.</p><p>The progression is Sandland is surprisingly linear and tied to the story, despite how open the map is. Even if you can defeat enemies and acquire parts (even blueprints/frames) for machines you don\'t have yet, you need a certain quality of materials to actually create them. The same goes for new parts or upgrades. And these materials are tied not only to your level but your story completion. There\'s also the incremental powerups and ""abilities"" that Belz gets as he levels up, but these are very basic and really only improve the not-often-used hand to hand combat, or story gated themselves. More impactful is upgrading your companions, which can give you access to strong abilities. But generally leveling up doesn\'t feel super impactful. On the other hand, going through the story is the best way to unlock new bots and to level up. The story also has a side progression meter, the expansion of the city of Spino, which upgrades your facilities and unlocks a lot of customization options.</p><p>Customization in Sandland is nearly perfect. Less impactfully gameplay wise is the housing, but also, they didn\'t have to include it, so its all bonus points. And they give you three rooms to deck out with whatever you want. More impactfully, all of the robots are fully customizable in terms of armament and appearance. The weapons behave noticeably differently and make for an interesting (if not super deep) nuance in playstyle. You can also paint them and give them decals. However its these last two where it falls a little bit short. More paint options and decal options would\'ve gone a long way. They should\'ve included a decal editor like Armored Core. And there should also be more options on where to place the decals as well.</p><p>The story is good, but it\'s been intentionally dumbed down. Rao is a great character. He should\'ve been the POV character instead of Belz. But I understand that Toriyama wrote for a younger audience, so I\'m not particularly disappointed. The main story was just as effective as it\'d been on the page or screen, and I appreciate the differences in each version. I enjoyed exploring the crashed battleships and big ruins (which I think they did a pretty good job of making feel unique). I even enjoyed the side questing and expanding Spino (which I count under the story), introducing a wonderfully wacky cast of characters and worldbuilding (even if it is kind of weird that you more or less act-of-god a city together). The final few missions are really emotional too.</p><p>The one other complaint I have is that the bandit factions are underutilized, particularly the implications about the jokers.</p><p>The combat and mechanics in SandLand are great for the most part. The mecha gameplay is wonderful. They drive really well and are fun to fight with. The robots feel similar along expected lineages, as do the enemies, but all feel different enough to be unique. And the enemies employ all the same robots that you do, so there\'s enough variety not to get stale quickly. Some even use advanced gear. However, its clear that there are a couple of these preset variants on each type of robot, and I wish they\'d just randomized the parts in the post-game so that each encounter was truly unique. The AI also leaves a lot to be desired, and to truly challenge yourself in most cases you have to intentionally avoid over leveling (or maybe even intentionally be under leveled).</p><p>On the other hand, the hand to hand combat gameplay is traditional and basic, and doesn\'t really add much. Its such an afterthought that you are discouraged from using it against ~70% of the enemies with the side characters literally telling you ""I wouldn\'t fight this unarmed!"". The ability wheel (both hand to hand and the Comrades) do add a little to make combat more complex, but not by much.</p><p>This is one of the areas where SandLand really suffers. A lot of the points of interest you find in the open world are highly repetitive (you will absolutely memorize the ruins layouts by the end of the game). The stealth segments aren\'t great.</p><p>One of the ones that really bothers me is the races. They aren\'t races, they\'re time trials. Your position within the group doesn\'t matter at all, only that you beat the timer. In fact, the other racers might as well not even be there. They aren\'t capable of hitting you with anything (you\'re moving too fast even for the tracking missiles) unless they\'re sitting on your ass with a shotgun (nor you them). The timer speed requires that you be solidly in the lead even for the bronze medal. Basically the best thing you can do with the races is just to boost ahead of everyone at the start and then completely ignore them the rest of the race. The race is all about optimization of the route more than anything else, since the distance between a purple and a red part is like .2 mph out of 80mph+. It behaves much more like a puzzle than a dynamic racing game.</p><p>That\'s not to say that all of the side activities are terrible, however. The Battle Arena is where you\'ll find the most challenging activities if you\'re not explicitly trying to make things difficult for yourself, which is quite welcome. Some of the bounty hunts can also be quite difficult.</p><p>I\'d love to see DLC or a sequel (Snowland, Shadowland, Lavaland, sealand, flatland (even though its gone), mountainland, whatever is across the sea that they were positing about) to expand the universe more, maybe including the Pirate/Battleship Guardian Mecha as a pilotable bot so we could get some sword action (maybe one of the alternate options could be a baseball bat) or the Airplane for actual flying bots or a submarine. I\'d also love a new-game plus where you could choose 1 of your existing bots to get instead of the default tank. They could replace the story rocks with rocks that break upon impact so you wouldn\'t need the tank at the beginning. Imagine trying to fight bosses in the Uniride lol. A horde mode would also be nice. Just take the Are boss fight and make it so that other kinds of bots can spawn and voilah, horde mode. Also, a AI upgrade tied to the difficulty slider would go a long way towards making the experience more challenging. Lastly, they should implement multiplayer/pvp in modes that seem designed for it like Racing and the Battle Arena. Also they should allow you to complete any race with any vehicle. </p><p>Overall, I\'d score Sandland a 8/10. It was a great experience and a fitting send off for Toriyama.

Even though the TV screen refresh rate it set to 60 hz (via Windows 11 on my connected Surface) and the games are also running at 60 hz, I notice visible (but admittedly minor) &#8220;stuttering&#8221; of background graphics when the screen is scrolling left/right or up/down. </p><p>Here are two videos I\'ve recorded off my TV screen. My iPhone doesn\'t quite capture how noticeable the stuttering is, but you should be able to see it a bit. In real life it\'s not too bad really, but I\'d like to try and eliminate it if possible:</p><p>Example 1 - Castlevania 2: Simon\'s Quest:</p><p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfipzFybZIg"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfipzFybZIg</a></p><p>Example 2 - Mega Man 2:</p><p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddwqzXGW91M"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddwqzXGW91M</a></p><p>The Surface Pro 8 is connected to the tv&#8217;s HDMI 2.1 port via a HDMI 2.1 cable and a USB C to HDMI adapter. ""Game mode"" on the TV is on. </p><p>I also get the same ""stuttering"" when I play these games on RetroArch on my Surface Pro 8 screen (without connecting to my TV). So it\'s not an issue with HDMI cables.</p><p>Given that the game frame rate and the tv refresh rate are supposed to be the same, I can only assume that somehow they are slightly out of &#8220;sync&#8221; for some reason or another. I have ""vertical sync"" turned on in RetroArch, though.</p><p>I also have RetroArch installed on my desktop computer with a G-Sync monitor. However, there is no such &#8220;stuttering&#8221; on that screen &#8211; neither of 60 hz NTSC games or 50 hz PAL games. The motion on screen is 100% flawless.</p><p>So, anyone here have any idea/s about how to get rid of this (minor) ""stuttering""?

While in the player inventory, the Dpad and the left stick moves from item to item but does not scroll.</p><p>Scrolling functionality should be the same in every UI window, so it is less confusing for the player. Its almost like learning something and trying to do the same thing but it works differently than you have already learned.</p><p>I hope the UI functionality could get more streamlined so its less frustrating for the player.</p><p>These controls will be for the Nintendo Switch Controller as that is what I am playing on currently.</p><p><strong>Right stick</strong> - Move cursor.</p><p><strong>Left stick</strong> - Scrolls while cursor is hovered over scrollable areas.</p><p><strong>D-pad</strong> - Selection (moving from one inventory item to the next, or one button to the next button).</p><p><strong>B button</strong> - Cancel.</p><p><strong>A button</strong> - Confirm/Interact.</p><p><strong>RB/LB</strong> - Sub-tabs(Inventory item types (Food, Weapons, Quest Items, etc...)).</p><p><strong>ZR/ZL</strong> - Main Tabs (Character Skills, Quest Log, Map, etc...).</p><p>When the cursor is <strong><em>HOVERING</em></strong> over a scrollable area, the left stick will allow scrolling <strong>ONLY</strong> on what is being hovered over. The Dpad will allow the selectable elements such as buttons or items to be selected such as moving up and down a list of items in the inventory.</p><p>When using the Dpad in the UI menus, all character functionality should not work, such as opening and closing the map, using a potion, etc...</p><p>The whole page could be managed with the dpad, moving from one button/interaction box to another. The cursor could be hidden until moved with right thumbstick and the left stick can scroll the scrollable area.</p><p>When the player interacts with a NPC, Sign, or even an object that prompts a dialog box. HIDE the cursor. There are already button inputs in place to accept, back, or cancel whatever is popping up on screen. There is no need for the cursor. <strong><em>(I know this is a minor suggestion, but still one none the less).</em></strong></p><p><strong>Cursor:</strong> Can hide cursor when not moving with right stick. Hides cursor after a couple seconds. (Cursor still needed for hovering over stats for tool tips).</p><p>This window can be managed with the dpad to move, equip or etc... with the items. Having the cursor always visible can cause some bugs which I have ran into already. <strong><em>(I will not get into this as this posting is just for suggestions)</em></strong><strong>.</strong></p><p>This is only looking at the item selection in the inventory.</p><p><strong>X button</strong> to bring up options with that item (Split, Discard, Use) and the Dpad to scroll up and down those different options.</p><p>&#8203;</p><p><a href=""https://preview.redd.it/m3vj30tinz6c1.jpg?width=293&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5a4a37ceab6bc2877888691ac7d7c603ce209e9a"">UI Prompt on an individual item when selected</a></p><p><strong>B button</strong> will exit out of that item UI prompt and back to the inventory.</p><p><strong>A button</strong> will interact with the item by picking it up.</p><p><strong>Y button</strong> can split items quickly by bringing the prompt up for it. Or it can quickly equip an item swapping the currently equipped item with the new one. <strong><em>(Either functionality I would go for personally).</em></strong></p><p>Can hide cursor when not moving with right stick. Hides cursor after a couple seconds after becoming visible.</p><p>This whole window can be selected/interacted with the Dpad. Move the dpad to the skill you want to upgrade, select that skill, and off to the right you can choose what you want to upgrade on that skill that is currently selected.</p><p>Not sure why the cursor appears here also, it is not needed as all the button inputs are visible and shown. Might as well hide the players cursor all together to get rid of unnecessary UI elements. <strong><em>(Cursor not shown in picture, I couldn\'t capture one for the posting).</em></strong></p><p>&#8203;</p><p><a href=""https://preview.redd.it/fadrimqfnz6c1.jpg?width=677&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=03160c587fdf0d0f0675e3161e4bcf22510236bd"">https://preview.redd.it/fadrimqfnz6c1.jpg?width=677&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=03160c587fdf0d0f0675e3161e4bcf22510236bd</a></p><p>Currently there is no key binding VISIBLE to know what button to press to use the potion.
